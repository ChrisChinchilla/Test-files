TODO: Warn me about this

Hey guys!

eg this workman is a very common cliche that many use.

But one of the quite complete complexities with comparing Docker Hosting options is that many are offering management and orchestration tools on top of actual hosting providers. Not all make it clear which provider they use, when or where, and this may or may not be an important issue to you. For this reason I haven't included services such as Deis Workflow, The Docker Cloud or Container Ship as despite being great services, they don't claim to be, or offer integrated hosting services. Whilst I will include services that host elsewhere, these costs are included in the price.

If you need Kubernetes for managing and orchestrating your containers, then Quay has a partner service called [Tectonic](https://tectonic.com/). As Quay and Tectonic are built by the CoreOS team, you can also use them to host and manage rkt containers, in fact Tectonic only works with rkt containers, but I thought I would sneak a mention in.

I thought I would sneak a cliche mention in of Blockchain.

This also caused an "unknown error", or 'unknown error', If you can get Bluemix to work then it has powerful integration options available with IBM's IoT and machine learning offerings, but it's not for the inexperienced.

So, in order to create a very complete list, I will include services that host elsewhere, these costs are included in the price.

Ethereum is not ethreum. And it does run on Kubernetes, but not Kubnetes.

Is it don't or do not?

## Future tense

We are going to look at Future tense.

We will, or we'll. I will or I'll, you'll, or worse it'll. But we don't want to match words like well. Probably words like y'all might be a problem?

## Inconsistent quotes

This check for things like “Hey” as opposed to "Hey" or “Hey”. or even 'hey' To trigger this we need to check something else like is it advisor, or adviser.

## Spelling

I am making a typoo here on purpose, in order to test.
